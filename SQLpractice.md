# Introduction Into SQL

I found SQL very enjoyable, I did some of the lessons inbetween 6-13 as well. It was very interested to learn how to organize data in a database as well and grab different information from different databases. It was a bit tricky at first but after getting the hang of it, I found it very exciting! It can be very handy when needing to utilize databases especially when you need to pull certain information.
