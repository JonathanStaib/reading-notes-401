# Class 01 Reading Notes

## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. Node is a way to enhance engines/browsers and input various features into them.

2. JavaSript runtime means that Node is a way for us to execute JavaScript on our computers.

3. It is used to run various tools, they can be used for many things. Such as, running tests, code linting, style checking and bundling your JAvaSCript files into static assets.

## Additional Questions

1. I am looking forward to learning more about react because I enjoyed it very much and struggled with it in 301 so I would like to get better with it. I haven't done regex in a while so I hope that is implemeneted into some code challenges as well, I am one of the few who enjoyed regex.

2. My learning goals for class today will be to get a good grasp on Node and how to use it as well as gain a better understanding on express servers.

## Lecture Notes

- ctrl c twice will get you out of node terminal
- nvm use '#' will set default version for node or maybe other things?
- DO NOT USE node modules you will get very low credit.
- .github/workflows/node.yml if you build a server or a react app, allows to see test results. Lose credit if not there, REQUIRED!
- npm init -y, npm i ''. little reminders

- middleware takes in req, res, next and can do some processing and can pass off the request to the NEXT middleware OR it can send a response.
- npm i jest and supertest to install tests into repo.
