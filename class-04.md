## nosql vs sql

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?
  The best fit for complex query intensive environment is SQL databases.
2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
  The best fit for hierachical data storages are NoSQL databases.
3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
  NoSQL are better databases for unstructured data. NoSQL databases are much more felxible when it comes to theur schema, "well what is a schema?" a schema is a way to help us organize information. Therefore SQL databases are much better for complex data because they use schemas and are much more strict and organized.

## SQL Modeling Techniques

1. A one to many table is an entry in a table that can be connected to more than one entry in another. We can relate to them because our server can be connected to many tests, I think is a good example for this.
2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ***make a UML*** of the database tables and their relationships.
3. The Primary key is to indentify each row in the table, there is usually only one but there can be more. The foreign key is there to match a primary key, matching these two together is what makes the database come togethere as a whole.

## SQL vs NoSQL

1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
 
2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.
