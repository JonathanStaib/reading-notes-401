# Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions:

This reading topic is important because we need to focus on our futures and not let distractions get ahead of us. The problem solving aspect I found very interesting as I usually solve things in a clutter at once, it usually works but I will practice taking my time and breaking problems down.

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
 I am very curious and a great problem solver. I may not have the most experience but I am very eager to learn. I also have strong teamwork from sports and E-Sports.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- I will slow down, take a breathe and assess my code. I will take it apart piece by piece and analyze where I could have went wrong or look for what is needed to complete my code.

- I could always bring the problem up with a colleugue or mentor to have them help me walk through it. It can always be nice to have a fresh pair of eyes and collabing on code can be very strong if utilized properly.

- Sometimes you just need to take a step away from the screen. This may be one of the time wasted activities but I like to play magic the gathering to clear my head. It feel it is a great way relax while also utilizing my mind. It is also a chance to step away from the computer for a short break.
