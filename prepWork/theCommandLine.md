## The Command Line

- you will always be presented a prompt, where there is a prompt... there can be a command following.
- Whenever you enter a command you will be given a response.
- When entering commands you can use options such as -l, they will change the behaviour of the command.

## Basic Navigation

- ls -l(long listing) will gives you tons of information about all files.
- files and directories are known as paths, a path is a way to get to get to a specific file / directory.
- relative and absolute paths, relative could be different responses based on where you are in the system. While absolute paths will always bring you to the same location.

## More About Files

- Linux looks inside the files to determine what it is, no matter what you name it, Linux will always read a file as it is. Very Cool.
- Linux is case sensitive so you can have multiple files with the same name but different capitals.
- You can have spaces in file names but to cd into them you will need to use quotes or \, very cool again.

## Manual Pages

- manual pages explain every command available to you on your system, can't believe I didn't know of this until now, can't wait to utilize it.
- you can search keywords in manual with `man -k<search>`.

## File Manipulation

- Develop the habit of organizing your files or it can become very difficult to find your way around.
- `-p` in mkdir is a way to create parent directories, awesome.
- `rmdir` to remove a directory
- `touch` to make a blank file
- `cp` to copy a file
- you can use `rm -r` to remove a directory even if it is not empty

I found many cool tips and tricks in this reading that I can't wait to try. I will also use it as a future reference when needed.
