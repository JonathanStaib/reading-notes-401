# Prep The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

Improving your technical skills can be your greatest asset in this field. It will give you more options when working and new knowledge. It may be boring but you will definetely thank yourself in the long run.

*Question 1:* A lot of the software I build pushes me outside of my comfort zone in Code Fellows. I am constantly learning new things each day and when I get an idea, even if I dont know how to do it, I will research how and try to get it done.

*Question 2:* I can work on typing quicker, I type very well when it is jsut words but it is hard for me to also mix symbols and numbers in their as well and that is very important for coding and I would like to improve in this area. I will start there with typing practice like we have in prep work.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

With the Not Yet/Growth mindset, you will never feel down about your work. You will feel more driven to succeed with this mindset rather than I give up, this is too hard/ Fixed Mindset. I have not completed it yet or I dont understand it yet is telling yourself you will get it eventually and dont give up.

Growth Mindest people will want to engage into difficulty. They want to challenge themselves and learn and correct.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

Having Grit is much more powerful than having IQ. Grit is about having stamina to stick through the hard time, to have perseverance. It is pursuing long term goals and sticking with it.

Grit and Growth Mindset go hand in hand accordng to Angela. Growth mindset being the ability to not have a fixed mindset and the drive to learn even if you can't grasp it at the time. Grit is also the way of sticking through challenging times.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

The main topic of this video was success and failure. Career Crisis is a big topic in the beginning of this discussion. People judge other based on their first impression of them. A good point was "what do you do for work?" and people just you based on what you do for work. I feel that this may scare people from going into the line of work that they desire in some instances possibly. Envy is the worst emotion in the world and it is worst the closer two people are because you can't be envious of someone you can't relate to. Don't judge others based on their careers or first impressions. You can't be successful at everything, you can't have it all. P.S. this guy was hilarious.

## Emotional Intelligence Survey

Self-Awareness: 24
Social-Awareness: 22
Self-Management: 20
Relationship Management: 21

I feel that my self-awareness is quite good. I am able to assess how I am feeling accurately and can control my emotions quite well. I never lash out at others or anything of the sort, I feel my self control is wuite good. I feel that I am better at gauging my own feelings than others emotions. It can be hard to see through masks sometimes but you can also easily read others body signs or tones of voice to gauge their emotions. I can definelty be symphatetic when others are down but sometimes it can be hard to undersatnd fully why they are feeling eh way they are when it can be the crazy situations sometimes.

## Assessing Bias

Which of the areas is your strongest?
My strongest areas were meaningful connections and effective courage.

Which of the areas is your weakest?
My weakest areas were what is bias and bias and identity.

Which of the areas will you focus on in the coming weeks and beyond?
I will try to further understand bias because I feel that I don't have bias towards others and I would like to understand it more.

Bias isn't anything I have ever really thought about too much, I have always looked at everyone as equals even if they come from hard pasts or great pasts. I feel everyone can make a great future for themselves. I feel that success and oppurtunity come from attitude and drive. I know that there are some people out there which is horrible that will try to stop someone's goals due to beliefs or appearance whcih I don't find acceptable.
